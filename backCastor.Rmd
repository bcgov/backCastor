# Overview

The cutblockSeqPrep uses a defined area to grab the spatial locations of cutblocks that have been harvested over the past 50 years in BC.

# Usage

```{r module_usage}
library(SpaDES)
library(SpaDES.core)
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library (keyring)

source(here::here("R/functions/R_Postgres.R"))

setPaths(modulePath = here::here("R/SpaDES-modules"))

times <- list(start = 0, end = 10)
parameters <- list(
  dataCastor = list(saveCastorDB = TRUE,
                     randomLandscape = list(100,100,0,100,0,100),
                     randomLandscapeZoneConstraint = 
                       data.table(variable = 'age', threshold = 140, type = 'ge', percentage = 20)
                    ),

                             resetAge = T # if True, converts road age and status from it's time sequence of simulation (e.g., simulated in year 1, 2, 3 etc.) to the time since the road was created or used (i.e., end time - roadyear and end time - roadstatus) which inverts the sequence (e.g., road was built 3, 2, 1 years ago)
                              )
)
modules <- list("backCastor")
objects <- list()

mySim <- simInit(times = times, params = parameters, modules = modules,
                 objects = objects, paths = paths)

```

# Events

The module queries the consolidated cutblocks data set that is stored within a postgres database

# Data dependencies

Boundary information - namely the file name, the column to query, the name of the boudary within the column and geometry name

## Input data

https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/harvested-areas-of-bc-consolidated-cutblocks-

## Output data

Produces a result set of cutblock schedules based on historic accounts
